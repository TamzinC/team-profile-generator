# team-profile-generator

## Description

Using what I have learnt so far about node.js, inquirer and Object-Oriented Programming, I have developed a Team Profile Generator. This aim of this app is to gather information about your team which can be viewed in a html file, where you will be able to view the employee name, role, ID, email and GitHub profile (or name of school they are attending if they are an intern).


## Installation

N/A



## Usage

To run the Team Profile Generator, you will need to have node and npm installed. Running the command node index.js will kick-start the app. 

It will first ask for the Manager details before displaying the main menu. From there you will be able to choose to add an Engineer or an Intern, there is no limit to how many employees you can add. 

Once you have finished adding all the employees in your team, simply select the 'Finish' option. This will generate a html file based on your responses which should look something like this:

You can also view a sample html file of this in the output folder of my repo.
